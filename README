# Installation

For installing the typeserver with the types included in the repository just type:

> cabal install

Maybe you first have to update cabal's package list. Do so by:

> cabal update

If everything compiled correctly you can now start a typeserver (i.e. on port 5000) by typing

> ~/.cabal/bin/typeserver 5000
